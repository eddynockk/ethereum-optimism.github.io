  "description": "Union is a member-owned credit protocol built on Ethereum where members can underwrite lines of credit to other member addresses. The Union Protocol is a credit network that enables any address to accumulate a credit line on-chain in a permission-less, crypto-native way. The protocol itself is not an underwriter of risk, rather a mechanism to lower the cost of coordinating trust into available credit.",
